# noteTaker_Express

## Project description

This is a simple project that will use local storage to save the notes made, and also gives you the choice to delete any notes you no longer need to have saved

## Technologies Used

* Express.js
* JavaScript

This is also the first app I did where your computer works as the server and wses the localhost:PORT

## Future Development

Id like to deploy it on heroku so that we can use the deployed app from any device

## How to use

While I manage to deploy the app on heroku, the app can only be used on desktop once its cloned into your computer. All you have to do is open the app on your code editor, and you open the integrated terminal, and run the following command:
```
npm i
node server.js
```
